The application takes in information from user input and returns the location of the event and creates an event for it with the invited user in Google Calendar (performed in Django)
These events are then displayed in the React frontend so that users can easily see all of their events and whether they have been completed or not (based on the date or the event).
Users can register for the app through a simple user Django form that takes in basic information. \n
The React App offers basic CRUD functionality, however the implementation with the Google API is limited to the Django form to allow the user several ways to schedule events with others. \n
The Google APIs that I used include:
  Google Geocoding API
  Google Maps API
  Google Roads API (Future implementation of this app will allow users to get directions to the specified location).
  Google Calendar API \n
The things used to build this application include:

The machine learning model takes in 13 different factors from the user including:
  Dependents
  Applicant and CoApplicant Income
  LoanAmount
  Loan_Amount_Term
  Credit_History
  Gender
  Married
  Education
  Self_Employed

Our app allows the user to upload a .mp3 file and then input a "keyword". The video will then be transcribed into a script and then the timestamp associated with the word will then be outputted to the application.

I created the Google Cloud Project, associated bucket and scripts to automatically upload files to the cloud and then have those videos transcribed

Additionally, I created the backend API was created using Django and Django Rest Framework to make API calls to Google Cloud, specifically the Google Speech to Text APIs and calls to upload the .mp3 file to a bucket in google cloud (if the file is longer than 1 minute long then google requires it to be placed in the bucket).

Here's a demo of how our project works!`,
